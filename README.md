# Location_Finder

I tried to find a location using co-ordinates. So that, I wrote this code/script. You may use this script on your smartphone also.<br>
The essential modules will be downloaded autometically. And the most importat thing is, It will work <b>Offline</b>
<br>
<h2>How To Use?</h2>
- clone or copy this script file

- Enter your first co-ordinate and then second co-ordinate
 <br> 
 Bingo!!! You will get your location.
